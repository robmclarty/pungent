# Pungent

A set of simple functional utilities for Javascript.

## Why?

I want to do more functional programming in Javascript and practice getting
used to its concepts. I made this repo to collect a set of functional utilities
that one might use as a way for me to, not only use them, but learn how to
implement them, and in so doing understand "functional" better (and thus make
better programs :)

## What?

The following are the functions that have been implemented:

- curry
- compose
- pipe
- map
- filter
- reduce

## Why is it called "pungent"?

I wanted to riff off the word "curry" and one definition said it was "a pungent
Indian dish", which I thought was funny. My code is also probably not the
hardest of the hardcore functions ever created and so I thought maybe they
would have a bit of a "smell" and thus be "pungent".
